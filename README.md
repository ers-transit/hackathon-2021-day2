# ERS Pre-launch Data Hackathon | Day 2
This repository contains a tutorial on how to use the [Eureka!](https://eurekadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to reduce NIRCam data.

Eureka! will eventually be capable of reducing data from any JWST instrument and fitting lightcurves . At the moment the package is under development, and currently works on NIRCam data only. If you are interested in contributing to Eureka!, check out the hackathon activities this week or contact Kevin Stevenson, Sebastian Zieba, or Laura Kreidberg. The code is not officially associated with JWST or the ERS team.

## Download the data
To run the tutorial, you will need simulated NIRCam data and some ancillary files. 
1. Use the terminal to make a directory on your computer to store the simulated data and ancillary files. At the command prompt, enter the following lines (replacing `User` with your home directory name, e.g. `Users/kreidberg`):
    ```
    >> mkdir /User/Data/JWST-Sim/NIRCam/
    >> cd /User/Data/JWST-Sim/NIRCam/
    >> mkdir Stage2
    >> mkdir ancil 
    ```
2. Download the [simulated NIRCam data](https://stsci.app.box.com/s/8r6kqh9m53jkwkff0scmed6zx42g307e/folder/136379342485) from the STScI Box site and save the files in the `Stage2` directory. The files are large (5 GB total) so the download may take a while. If your internet connection is slow, download the [smallest file only](https://stsci.app.box.com/s/8r6kqh9m53jkwkff0scmed6zx42g307e/file/809097167084) and the tutorial will still work.
3. Save the [NIRCam calibration data](https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day2/tree/main/ancil_files/NIRCam) in the `ancil` directory.

## Configuring your python environment:
If you have not already installed Anaconda and set up the `ers-transit` environment, please follow the instructions in the Day 0 tutorial: https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day0/blob/main/hackathon-day0-tutorial.ipynb

## Starting the tutorial
1. Clone this repository, in one of two ways:
    - if you have git installed, open a terminal window, navigate to the location you want to run the tutorial, and type ``>> git clone https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day2.git``
    - if you do not have git, click on the green ``Code`` button in the upper right of this page and then click ``Download ZIP``
2. From your terminal window, navigate to the hackathon-2021-day2 directory.
3. Activate the ers-transit conda environment using ``conda activate ers-transit``
4. Open the file S3_wasp43b.ecf and update the three directories at the end of the file (topdir, datadir, and ancildir) to the directories you created in Step 1 of ``Getting Started``.
5. Open a jupyter notebook by typing ``jupyter notebook`` in your terminal window.
6. On the screen that opens, click ``hackathon-day2-tutorial.ipynb`` to start.
