# ERS Pre-launch Data Hackathon | Day 2
This repository contains a tutorial on how to use the eureka package to reduce NIRCam data.

## Getting started
To run the tutorial, you will need:
1. simulated NIRCam data (all simulated data are available at https://stsci.app.box.com/s/8r6kqh9m53jkwkff0scmed6zx42g307e/folder/135008457626)
2. ancillary data files (available in this directory: FIXME)

## Configuring your python environment:
If you have not already installed Anaconda and set up the `ers-transit` environment, please follow the instructions in the Day 0 tutorial: https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day0/blob/main/hackathon-day0-tutorial.ipynb
